- A **visually perfect graph** 🟩 every day accounted for  
- A **safe and local process**, without touching private data  
- A **beautifully organized Git history** with timestamps and traceability

This project is intended for using GitHub’s graph visualization, demonstrating automation concepts, or preserving chronological commit logs in a reproducible way.
